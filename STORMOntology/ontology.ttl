More specifically, the ontology focuses on metaphors found in Shakespearean works and the ways in which they reflect the universality of narrative structure, as anticipated in theories of narratology. With this project we attempt to demonstrate that metaphors do not only shed light on universal narrative elements, but that they may also provide insight into the main ideas of a story." .

   owl:annotatedTarget """Fear is a common feeling in life, sometimes we don’t want it, and sometimes we need it in order to achieve a potential goal. The quote in Act 5, Scene 5 of Macbeth “I have almost forgot the taste of fears” highlights Macbeths juxtaposing feelings from the beginning of the play. The quote is a metaphor and portrays a ‘stone’ like Macbeth who forgets the feelings of emotions, as it has been so long since Macbeth has been scared. Macbeth has not been scared for a while as he has been hurting others and no-one is brave enough to stop him.
Macbeth has changed throughout the play from an emotional man who would double guess his decisions to a person who will do anything for a certain title. Macbeth ‘forgets the taste of fear’ as he has been in a drought where his only thoughts are about power and not about his emotions or feelings. Macbeth only feeds on power and nothing else allows him to survive.""" ;

:Location rdfs:comment "This class includes important theories on the universal division of the narrative structure. We employed Hegel's stages, Greimas' narrative program and Yorke's midpoint to divide the plays and define the location of the metaphors. It is worth mentioning here that what is of importance is not the physical location of the metaphors in the story (e.g. the scene, the act etc), but their narrative location, i.e. the specific moment in the flow of events in which they were articulated." .
